# Elem-war-LibGdx-game
Elem-War is a match 4 tile based android game. I created this using libGdx, a Java framework. One gets to control a spaceship in order to win over an approaching set of tile army. The entire game including sound effects, animations, algorithm, etc was developed by me. It has been a wonderful experience while developing this game.
